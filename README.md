# MRSBFH - Matrix-Rust-SDK-Bot-Framework-Helper

A toolkit for writing commandbots more efficient in rust for matrix.

## How to use

To use it you need to add mrsbfh ust like any regular create:

```
mrsbfh = {git = "https://github.com/MTRNord/mrsbfh"}
```

After that there are the possible helpers available that are further described in the docs.

As there was no release yet, you can open them using `cargo doc -p mrsbfh --open` in any crate depending on it or after cloning the repository.

For a minimal example of the bot checkout the crate under the `example-bot` folder which is a minimal version of what is needed.
